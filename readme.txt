Provides a facility for hosting and distributing updates for your own WordPress plugins

== Description ==

This plugin enables you to host updates for your own plugins from your own WordPress site.

i.e. It provides a service for the availability and download of WordPress plugin updates - just like the wordpress.org plugin repository.

It is a free, cleaned-up version of the plugin updates server that has been providing plugin updates to thousands of users of the paid versions of <a href="https://updraftplus.com">the UpdraftPlus backup/restore/clone WordPress plugin</a> since 2013.

The best way to get a feel for its features is to take a look at the available screenshots.

= Features =

* Manage multiple plugins

* Have multiple different zips (i.e. different plugin versions) available for your plugins

* Have sophisticated rules for which zip a particular user gets delivered (e.g. send them an older version if they are on an old version of WordPress or PHP)

* Counts plugin downloads, by version - calculate how many active users you have

* Shortcode provided for showing users on your website what plugins are available

This version of the plugin supports hosting free plugins only - i.e. it does not support any restrictions upon access to plugins and updates. A premium version that adds support for paid plugins, and includes WooCommerce integration, may be released in future.

Running an updates server is one part of providing plugin updates to your users. You will also need to add code in your plugin to point towards that updates server. A popular class used for this purpose, that requires you to do nothing more than include it and tell it the updates URL, is available here: https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker
